# TO DO
* Add different customisable search engines to set as default (now: google, future: options like reddit, wikipedia, bing (haha), etc. maybe even custom engines);
* Finish weather page.
* Throw away all the weather page work. Then move it to the Main page as a pop-up that starts at the bottom.
